## Examples in this repository


### `app.R`
Example shiny app deployment through github.  In order to run this you need:

`shiny::runGitHub(repo = "DST490-day14",username = "AugsburgDST490")`

**NOTE:** When you create your own github shiny server:

- Repository visibility needs to be set as public.
- Main file needs to be named `app.R`.
